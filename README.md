# Tailwind CSS Bug: Missing or Invalid Utility Classes

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Tailwind CSS: missing or invalid utility classes.  The bug showcases a scenario where expected styling isn't applied due to configuration or compilation problems.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file contains a simple HTML structure with Tailwind CSS classes.  However, due to a simulated configuration error, the Tailwind classes are not interpreted correctly, resulting in the styles being missing.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected version with the proper configuration (or corrected class names) to resolve the issue.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the problem.
3. Open `bugSolution.js` to see the solution.

This example emphasizes the need to carefully verify Tailwind CSS configuration,  ensure that the correct Tailwind directives are included in your CSS, and double-check that the compiler correctly processes and injects the required styles.
